Am I the A-hole?

One day, I felt the need to address a sensitive issue with a close friend. I thought I was doing the right thing by bringing it up, hoping it would lead to a constructive conversation. However, as emotions ran high and words were exchanged, the situation took an unexpected turn. Now, I find myself questioning if I might be the one in the wrong. It's a dilemma that has me reflecting on my intentions and the potential impact of my words on our relationship.
